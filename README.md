Welcome to my blog. My name is Akeem Heshimu otherwise known as slient.coder on Instagram. I will mostly post my coding experiences and all of the projects I've worked on or any new upcoming projects I'd be intrested in doing.

HOW I BECAME TO BE:
When I first started coding I had struggled a lot because of learning all the small shortcuts.
